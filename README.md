|           | Base64       | RCNB                                                          |
|-----------|--------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|

| Printable | ❌ On all OS  | ✔️ Jvm supports almost all os! |
| Niubility | ❌ Not at all | ✔️ RCNB!                                                     |
